🚀 Thrilled to share my latest **Power BI dashboard project** where I leveraged **DAX, KPIs, and slicers** to bring sales data to life!

🔹 **Key Insights Unlocked:**
✔️ **Total Sales**: \$3.32M
✔️ **Profit Margin**: \$1.32M
✔️ **Top Selling Product**: 1992 Ferrari 360 Spider Red 🏎️
✔️ 2004 Sales: \$0.43M (📈 +54.97% above goal)
✔️ Clear breakdown of **Top 5 vs Bottom 5 Products**
✔️ Sales & Quantity trends by **Order Year & Product Line**

🔹 **What I applied in this project:**
✅ **DAX measures** to calculate Sales, Profit Margin & Goal Achievement %
✅ **KPIs** for performance tracking against targets
✅ **Slicers (Year, City, Product Line, Employee)** for interactive exploration
✅ **Data modeling** to ensure accuracy and seamless relationships
✅ Engaging visuals (bar charts, treemaps, pie charts) for **data storytelling**

💡 The power of **slicers + KPIs + DAX** truly helps transform raw data into **actionable insights** for better business decision-making.

Excited to keep learning and applying these techniques in real-world scenarios! 🚀
