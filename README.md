✅ **KPIs** for performance tracking against targets
✅ **Slicers (Year, City, Product Line, Employee)** for interactive exploration
✅ **Data modeling** to ensure accuracy and seamless relationships
✅ Engaging visuals (bar charts, treemaps, pie charts) for **data storytelling**

💡 The power of **slicers + KPIs + DAX** truly helps transform raw data into **actionable insights** for better business decision-making. 🚀
